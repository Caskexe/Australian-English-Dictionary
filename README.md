## Notice

Please don't send complaints or report the Firefox extension for profanity. The purpose of the dictionary is to include all coloUrful language used in Australia. As such there are plenty of bad words, slangs and racist remarks included in the dictionary that may not be appropriate for all. Simply don't type the words and they won't need correcting.
