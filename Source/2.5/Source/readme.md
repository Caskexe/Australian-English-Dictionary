**You** can support **ME** (so I don't have to resort to Cenno) by buying me a beer (actually, I don't drink beer - Un-Australian or what?!

## Stuffs to know:
Some words may be duplicates or alternate spellings due to the fact that they're not really words and people have all sorts of ways of spelling them (for example: you-ey, uie, youie). This is purely to avoid those horrible red underlines.
**The dictionary files contain a whole tonne of racist, offensive and naughty words. Please don't send complaints or report the extension for its profanity or offensive language.** 
The purpose of the dictionary is to include all coloUrful language used in Australia. As such, there are plenty of bad words, slang and racist remarks included in the dictionary that may not be appropriate for all.
 - ***How to avoid seeing offensive words:***
	  - Don't type them. Then they won't be visible or require correcting! Simple as!
